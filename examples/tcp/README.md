# TCP 

TCP’s principal characteristic is that it is a reliable protocol by
design. If there is no proof of a packet’s delivery, TCP will resend the
packet. Some of the tasks TCP packets can be used for are establishing
connections, transferring data, sending acknowledgements, and closing
connections.
